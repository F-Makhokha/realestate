Her friendly personality and professional manner were really amazing. We listed our house on a Tuesday and it was sold on Friday, it only took four days! Monica's flexible schedule made it possible for use to close the deal at 11:45pm since we had to go out of town first thing the next morning. If you are in the market for a realtor, she is it!\"",
